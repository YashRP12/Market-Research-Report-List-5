<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The LNG Liquefaction Turboexpander Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Centrifugal Turboexpander</li><li>Axial-flow Turboexpander</li><li>Others</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The LNG liquefaction turboexpander market can be segmented into three main types based on their design and operation: centrifugal turboexpander, axial-flow turboexpander, and others. Centrifugal turboexpanders use radial flow to convert kinetic energy into mechanical energy, while axial-flow turboexpanders use axial flow for the same purpose. The "others" category includes various types of turboexpanders that do not fit into the centrifugal or axial-flow categories. Each type of turboexpander has its own unique features and advantages for LNG liquefaction applications.</p></p>
