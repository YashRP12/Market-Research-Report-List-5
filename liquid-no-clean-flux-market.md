<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Liquid No-Clean Flux Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Low Residue</li><li>Extremely Low Residue</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Liquid No-Clean Flux can be categorized into two main types based on the level of residue they leave behind after soldering. Low residue flux leaves a small amount of residue that is easily cleaned with minimal effort. On the other hand, extremely low residue flux leaves almost no residue at all, making it ideal for applications where any residue is unacceptable. Both types offer the advantage of requiring no additional cleaning after soldering, but extremely low residue flux is preferred for industries with high standards for cleanliness.</p></p>
