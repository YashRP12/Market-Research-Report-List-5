<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Preimplantation Genetic Diagnostics (PGD) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Preimplantation Genetic Screening</li><li>Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Preimplantation Genetic Diagnostics (PGD) refers to a procedure used during in vitro fertilization to identify genetic abnormalities in embryos before implantation. There are two main types of PGD: Preimplantation Genetic Screening (PGS) which screens for genetic disorders or chromosomal abnormalities, and Preimplantation Genetic Diagnosis (PGD) which specifically tests for a known genetic disease in the parents. Both PGS and PGD are valuable tools in assisted reproductive technology, allowing for the selection of healthy embryos for implantation, thereby reducing the risk of passing on genetic disorders to offspring.</p></p>
