<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Vascular Interventional Surgery Robot Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Image Navigation</li><li>Magnetic Navigation</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Vascular interventional surgery robots are equipped with image navigation technology, which allows for precise navigation within the patient's body during minimally invasive procedures. This technology helps surgeons accurately reach their target areas and perform procedures with greater precision. On the other hand, magnetic navigation uses magnetic fields to guide the robot within the body, allowing for more flexible movement and access to hard-to-reach areas. Both types of navigation technologies enhance the effectiveness and safety of vascular interventional procedures.</p></p>
