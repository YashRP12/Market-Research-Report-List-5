<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Solid State Transformers (SST) Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Single-stage</li><li>Two-stage</li><li>Three-stage</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Solid State Transformers (SST) are classified into three different market types based on the number of stages they have: single-stage, two-stage, and three-stage. In single-stage SSTs, power is converted directly from high voltage AC to low voltage DC. In two-stage SSTs, power is first converted from high voltage AC to medium voltage DC before being converted to low voltage DC. Three-stage SSTs go through an additional step of converting the low voltage DC to higher frequency AC before being converted back to low voltage DC.</p></p>
