<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Laboratory Steam Sterilizers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Gravity Cycle</li><li>SFPP Cycle</li><li>Pre-Vac Cycle</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Laboratory Steam Sterilizers come in three different types based on the sterilization cycle used: Gravity Cycle, SFPP Cycle, and Pre-Vac Cycle. Gravity Cycle relies on gravity to remove air from the chamber before steam is introduced. SFPP Cycle introduces steam gradually to prevent sudden pressure spikes. Pre-Vac Cycle uses a vacuum to remove air from the chamber before steam is added. Each type has its own advantages and is suitable for different applications in laboratory settings, offering flexibility and efficiency in sterilizing equipment and materials.</p></p>
