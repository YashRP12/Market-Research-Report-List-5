<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Transportable Pediatric Ventilator Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Intrusive</li><li>Non-invasive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Intrusive transportable pediatric ventilators require insertion of a tube into the child's airway, providing mechanical ventilation. These are typically used in severe respiratory conditions. Non-invasive ventilators, on the other hand, deliver respiratory support without the need for intubation, making them more comfortable for the patient. They are often used for less severe respiratory conditions or for long-term respiratory support. Both types of ventilators play a crucial role in providing life-saving respiratory assistance to pediatric patients in need.</p></p>
