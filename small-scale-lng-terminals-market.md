<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Small Scale LNG Terminals Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Liquefaction Terminals</li><li>Regasification Terminals</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Small scale LNG terminals are divided into two main market types: liquefaction terminals and regasification terminals. Liquefaction terminals are facilities that cool natural gas to its liquid form for storage and transportation, while regasification terminals convert LNG back into its gaseous form for distribution and consumption. Liquefaction terminals are mainly located near gas production sites, while regasification terminals are typically situated near demand centers to facilitate the delivery of LNG to end-users. Both types of terminals play a crucial role in the LNG supply chain.</p></p>
