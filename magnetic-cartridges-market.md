<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Magnetic Cartridges Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Moving Magnet (MM)</li><li>Moving Coil (MC)</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Magnetic cartridges come in two main types: Moving Magnet (MM) and Moving Coil (MC). Moving Magnet cartridges use a magnet to induce a voltage in a stationary coil, producing the audio signal. Moving Coil cartridges on the other hand, use a coil attached to the stylus to produce the signal. MM cartridges are typically less expensive, easier to set up, and have a warmer sound, while MC cartridges offer superior tracking ability, detail, and accuracy, but are typically more expensive and require a higher-quality turntable for optimal performance.</p></p>
