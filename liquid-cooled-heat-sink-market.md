<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Liquid-cooled Heat Sink Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Conductable</li><li>Immersive</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Conductable liquid-cooled heat sinks are designed to directly transfer heat from the heat source to the liquid circulating in the heat sink. This type of heat sink is highly efficient and provides quick heat dissipation. On the other hand, immersive liquid-cooled heat sinks submerge the entire heat sink in a liquid coolant, allowing for maximum surface area contact and heat absorption. This type is often used in high-performance computing applications where maintaining a low temperature is crucial for optimal performance. Both types are effective in dissipating heat efficiently.</p></p>
