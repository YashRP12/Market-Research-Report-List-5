<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Infrared Bandpass Filters Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Wideband</li><li>Narrowband</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Infrared bandpass filters are commonly categorized into two main types: wideband and narrowband filters. Wideband filters allow a broader range of infrared wavelengths to pass through, making them suitable for applications requiring a wide spectrum of infrared light. On the other hand, narrowband filters are designed to only allow a specific narrow range of wavelengths to pass through, making them ideal for applications where precise filtering of infrared light is needed. Both types of filters play a crucial role in various industries such as healthcare, defense, and surveillance.</p></p>
