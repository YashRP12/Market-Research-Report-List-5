<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The NOx Adsorbers Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Active NOx Adsorbers</li><li>Passive NOx Adsorbers</li></ul></p>
<p><p>NOx adsorbers are devices used to reduce nitrogen oxide emissions in vehicles. Active NOx adsorbers require external conditions such as high temperatures to function effectively, while passive NOx adsorbers do not need external conditions and can operate at lower temperatures. Active adsorbers are more efficient but require more energy, making them suitable for heavy-duty vehicles. Passive adsorbers are simpler and more cost-effective, making them ideal for light-duty vehicles. The market for both types of adsorbers is driven by environmental regulations pushing for lower emissions.</p></p>
