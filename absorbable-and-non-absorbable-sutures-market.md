<p><h1>Absorbable and Non Absorbable Sutures Market Size: Global Industry Overview, Market Segmentation and Forecast (2024 to 2031)</h1></p><p><strong>Absorbable and Non Absorbable Sutures Market Analysis and Latest Trends</strong></p>
<p><p>Absorbable sutures are sutures that are designed to be broken down and absorbed by the body over time, eliminating the need for removal after the wound has healed. They are commonly made from materials such as polyglycolic acid, polylactic acid, and polydioxanone. Non-absorbable sutures, on the other hand, are made from materials such as silk, nylon, polyester, or stainless steel and must be removed by a healthcare professional once the wound has healed.</p><p>The Absorbable and Non Absorbable Sutures Market is expected to grow at a CAGR of 12.20% during the forecast period. Factors driving this growth include the increasing number of surgical procedures being performed globally, as well as technological advancements in the field of surgery. Additionally, the growing prevalence of chronic diseases such as cardiovascular diseases, cancer, and diabetes is also contributing to the market growth as these conditions often require surgical intervention.</p><p>One of the latest trends in the Absorbable and Non Absorbable Sutures Market is the development of sutures that are coated with antimicrobial agents to reduce the risk of infection post-surgery. This innovation is particularly important in light of the increasing prevalence of antibiotic-resistant bacteria. Another trend is the growing adoption of minimally invasive surgical techniques, which require sutures that are strong, yet flexible, to ensure optimal wound closure.</p></p>

<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Absorbable and Non Absorbable Sutures Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Absorbable Sutures</li><li>Non-Absorbable Sutures</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Absorbable sutures are used in surgeries where the body tissues will heal on their own and the sutures do not need to be removed. They are broken down by the body over time and are typically made of materials like catgut or polyglactin. Non-absorbable sutures, on the other hand, are used in procedures where long-term wound support is needed and they need to be removed manually. They are often made of materials like nylon or silk. Both types of sutures play a crucial role in the field of surgery.</p></p>
