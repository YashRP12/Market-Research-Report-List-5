<p><ul><li>Sodium Lauryl Sulphate (SLS)</li><li>SLS Free</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Emulsifying ointments with Sodium Lauryl Sulphate (SLS) are widely used in skincare products due to their ability to create stable emulsions. However, SLS is known to cause skin irritation and sensitivity in some individuals, leading to the emergence of the SLS-free market.
