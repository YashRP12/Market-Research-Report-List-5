<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Steering Position Sensor Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Magnetic Sensor</li><li>Contacting Sensor</li></ul></p>
<p><p>Steering position sensors are available in two main types - magnetic sensors and contacting sensors. Magnetic sensors use a magnet and Hall-effect sensor to detect steering angle, providing accurate and reliable measurements. Contacting sensors, on the other hand, use physical contact between components to determine steering position. While magnetic sensors are generally more durable and offer longer lifespan, contacting sensors may be more cost-effective and simpler to integrate into existing systems. Both types have their own advantages and are used in different applications based on requirements.</p></p>
